## In the begining ...

Bibling is a free commnad line tool you can use to interact with the Bible. It provides access to the BibleGateway online services. An internet connection is required in order to use this tool.

To start using it, you first need to install the tool. Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed in your system and then run `npm install --global bibling`

## And God said

Use `bibling <reference>` to discover what God said. The reference can be whatever you want to search for, or just a simple bible book reference as for instance `Gen1:1`, which will retrieve The first verse of the first chapter of the book Genesis. Just go ahead and give it a try by running `bibling gen1:1`. To get the complete list of all available actions, type in your terminal `bibling --help`
